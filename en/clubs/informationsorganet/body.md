# Informationsorganet (Ior)

Informationsorganet is a special club in the section. We work hard to make communication and information spread easier among the section members. To help us with this we use the sections website, facebook and the TV-screens in META.

Ior has two great advantages compared with the other parts of the section. First of all we work a lot with technology and technical solutions, something you are probably positive to if you are a studying computer science. We are basically the part of the section which works the most with computers. Secondly, contributing to IOR is not harder than you make it. Do you have little spare time? Then there are smaller things that you could help build! Do you have an idea for something complicated but useful for spreading information that you would like to build? Then there is help in IOR!

Are you intereseted in computers and communications? Then Ior is the right club for you!

    “IORs main purpose is to promote and handle information flow, to, from and between the members of datasektionen”

Do you have information that you want published, opinions about something or just a question? Just email us at ior@d.kth.se (please write a clear subject). For version control we use Github](https://github.com/datasektionen).
